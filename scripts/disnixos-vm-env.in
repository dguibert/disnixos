Usage: $0 -s services_nix -n network_nix [ -n network_nix ... ] -d distribution_nix [OPTION]

The command \`disnixos-vm-env' is used to generate and launch a network of
virtual machines, closely matching the machine configurations defined in the
network model.

This command requires three Nix expressions as input parameters; A services
model capturing the components of a distributed system and its
inter-dependencies; A network model capturing the NixOS configurations of
machines in the network and its properties and a distribution model which maps
services to machines.

By invoking this command, it will first build a network of virtual machines,
closely matching the NixOS configurations in the network model. Then it will
build all the services that are defined in the distribution model from source
code including all its dependencies. Finally, it launches the virtual machines
and deploys the system into the virtual network.

Options:
  -s, --services=services_nix          Services Nix expression which describes
                                       all components of the distributed system
  -n, --network=network_nix            Network Nix expression which declares a
                                       NixOS configuration for each machine in
                                       the network
  -d, --distribution=distribution_nix  Distribution Nix expression which maps
                                       services to machines in the network
      --show-trace                     Shows a trace of the output
  -h, --help                           Shows the usage of this command
  -v, --version                        Shows the version of this command
