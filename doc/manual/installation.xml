	<para>
		This chapter explains how DisnixOS can be installed. Except for the basic 
		<link xlink:href="http://nixos.org/disnix">Disnix</link> 
		toolset, only the coordinator machine needs the DisnixOS
		exentension tools.

		<title>Compiling DisnixOS from source</title>

		<para>
			This section explains how to compile DisnixOS from source code.
			Usually, this is only needed in special circumstances such as for 
			development, or trying a new platform. A more convenient way to install
			DisnixOS is to use the Nix package manager.

			<title>Prerequisites</title>
			<para>
				In order to build DisnixOS from source code, the following dependencies are required:
				Since it is an extension to
				<link xlink:href="http://nixos.org/disnix">Disnix</link>,
				the core Disnix toolset must be installed. Have a look for 
				installation instructions in the Disnix manual.
				Moreover, for network communication, DisnixOS uses
				<link xlink:href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat">socat</link>,
				which must also be present on the system.
			</para>

			<title>Compiling DisnixOS</title>

			<para>
				After unpacking or checking out the DisnixOS sources, it can be
				compiled by executing the following commands:

<screen>
$ ./configure <replaceable>options...</replaceable>
$ make
$ make install
</screen>
			</para>

			<para>
				When building from the Subversion repository, these should be
				preceded by the command:

<screen>
$ ./bootstrap
</screen>
			</para>

			<para>
				The installation path can be specified by passing the
				<option>--prefix=<replaceable>prefix</replaceable></option> to
				<command>configure</command>. The default installation directory is
				<filename>/usr/local</filename>. You can change this to any location
				you like.  You must have write permission to the
				<replaceable>prefix</replaceable> path.

		<title>Installing DisnixOS by using the Nix package manager</title>

		<para>
			The easiest way to use DisnixOS is by installing the DisnixOS package with
			the Nix package manager from the
			<link xlink:href="http://nixos.org/nixpkgs">Nixpkgs</link>
			repository by typing:

<screen>
$ nix-env -i disnixos
</screen>

			Another way is downloading the DisnixOS source distribution
			and to compile it manually. Moreover, it is also a good thing to have
			to basic Disnix toolset in your environment. This can be done by typing:
		</para>

<screen>
$ nix-env -i disnix
</screen>

		<para>
			A copy of
			<link xlink:href="http://nixos.org/nixpkgs">Nixpkgs</link> is required
			and an environment variable <code>NIXPKGS_ALL</code> must point to the path where
			it is installed, so that Disnix is able to find it. In NixOS, a copy is 
			already present and this environment variable has already been configured.
			On other systems this variable can be configured by adding the following lines to your
			<filename>~/.bash_profile</filename> configuration (or another configuration
			file, if you use a different shell):
		</para>
		
<screen>
$ cat &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile &lt;&lt;EOF
# Begin Nixpkgs addition

NIXPKGS_ALL=/path/to/nixpkgs/pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix
export NIXPKGS_ALL

# End Nixpkgs addition
EOF
